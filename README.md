  ## Installation: 
  First, clone this repository to your computer using 'git@github.com:zmuda44/Module-12-Challenge-create-CMS-app.git'. cd into the folder containing the index.js. Run 'npm i' from the command line to create your node modules. A package.json will be cloned with all proper dependencies and npm i will install all modules from these dependencies. cd into the 'db' folder containing the schema.sql and log into your Postgres account. You will first need to download Postgres and get a database server up and running. Run '\i schema' from the postgres command line to create your database on the server. Seed your database: The postgres command system should automatically be in the database you just created after running \i schema.sql. Run \i seeds.sql to seed your database. Exit out of the Postgres command by typing '\q'. You will once again cd into the folder containing index.js and start using app (instructions below).

  ## Usage: 
  Once you have installed the modules, created the database and tables and seeded the data, you are ready to start using. Run 'node index.js' from the folder that contains the server.js file to start your server. Follow the prompts on screen to use app. It is recommended to open pgAdmin, which is packaged with Postgres to view all changes to your database.
